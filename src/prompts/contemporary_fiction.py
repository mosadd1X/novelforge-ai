        Visual Elements to Consider:
        *   **Imagery:** What kind of images would best represent the story's themes and setting? (e.g., landscapes, cityscapes, portraits, abstract designs) Should the imagery be realistic, stylized, or symbolic?

        *   **Overall Tone:** What feeling should the back cover design convey? (e.g., hopeful, mysterious, emotional, thought-provoking)

        Example:
        "For a novel set in a bustling modern city about a young woman struggling with identity, I envision a back cover with a slightly blurred cityscape in muted blues and grays. The typography should be clean and modern, with a sans-serif font. The overall tone should be reflective and a little melancholic, hinting at the protagonist's inner turmoil."
