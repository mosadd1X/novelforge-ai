- **Setting as Character**: Consider how the setting can be used to reflect the themes of the story and the emotional states of the characters. Outline key settings and their symbolic significance.
- **Internal Conflict**: Emphasize the internal struggles of your characters. Outline the nature of these conflicts and how they will be resolved (or not) by the end of the story.
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Outline the key relationships between characters and how they will evolve throughout the story. Focus on the complexities and nuances of these relationships.
- **Symbolic Structure**: Consider using a symbolic structure to organize your story, such as a journey, a quest, or a descent into darkness.

## Literary Fiction-Specific Character Development

- **Subtext and Implication**: Use subtext and implication to convey deeper meaning and create a sense of unease or tension.
- **Symbolic Imagery**: Employ symbolic imagery to reinforce the themes of the story and add layers of meaning to the narrative.

- **Character-Driven Scenes**: Ensure that each scene is driven by the characters' actions and decisions. Avoid scenes that are purely expositional or plot-driven.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Strive to create scenes that resonate emotionally with the reader, evoking feelings of empathy, sadness, joy, or anger.
