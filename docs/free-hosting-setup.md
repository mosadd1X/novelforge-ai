As a student with zero budget, you can still run a professional Telegram marketing system! This guide shows you how to use **completely free** hosting solutions that are perfect for automated book publishing.

```bash
# Make sure your NovelForge AI is in a GitHub repository
git add .
git commit -m "Add Telegram publishing system"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Run this command in your NovelForge AI directory:
```bash
python scripts/telegram_auto_publisher.py --setup
```

## ðŸ¤– Telegram Bot Setup

### 1. Create Your Bot

2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name: "YourName Book Publisher"
4. Choose a username: "yourname_books_bot"
5. Copy the token (looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

### 2. Create Your Channel

1. Create a new Telegram channel
2. Make it public with a username (e.g., @yourname_books)
3. Add your bot as an administrator
4. Give it permission to post messages

### 3. Get Channel ID

- If your channel is `@yourname_books`, use `@yourname_books` as channel ID

**Method 2: Get Numeric ID**
1. Add your bot to the channel as admin
2. Send a message to your channel
3. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
4. Look for your channel ID (starts with `-100`)

## ðŸ“… Publishing Schedule Options

### Conservative Schedule (Recommended for Free Hosting)
```yaml
# Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 10 AM
- cron: '0 10 * * 1,3,5'
```

### Daily Schedule
```yaml
# Every day at 2 PM
- cron: '0 14 * * *'
```

### Custom Schedule
```yaml
# Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM
- cron: '0 18 * * 2,4'
```

## ðŸ’¾ Database Considerations

### GitHub Actions Approach
- Database updates are committed back to repository
- Perfect for small-scale operations
- No additional storage costs

### Cloud Hosting Approach
- Use SQLite file in the container
- For Railway/Render, database persists between deployments
- Consider upgrading to PostgreSQL for heavy usage

## ðŸ”§ Configuration for Free Hosting

### Environment Variables Setup

**For GitHub Actions:**
Add to repository secrets:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=@your_channel_name
```

**For Railway/Render:**
Add in platform dashboard:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=@your_channel_name
POSTING_SCHEDULE=conservative
MAX_BOOKS_PER_RUN=3
```

### Resource Optimization

**Memory Usage:**
```python
# In your publishing script
import gc

async def publish_book(self, book_data):
    # ... publishing logic ...
    gc.collect()  # Free memory after each book
```

**Database Optimization:**
```python
# Use connection pooling
with self.db_manager.get_connection() as conn:
    # Do all database operations
    pass  # Connection automatically closed
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your Free Setup

### GitHub Actions Monitoring
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Check workflow runs for success/failure
3. View logs for debugging

### Railway/Render Monitoring
1. Check platform dashboard for deployment status
2. View application logs
3. Monitor resource usage

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**GitHub Actions Not Running:**
- Check if Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Verify cron syntax in workflow file
- Check repository secrets are set correctly

**Bot Not Posting:**
- Verify bot token is correct
- Check bot is admin in channel
- Ensure channel ID format is correct

**Database Not Updating:**
- For GitHub Actions: Check if workflow has write permissions
- For cloud hosting: Verify database file permissions

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Bot token invalid" | Re-create bot with @BotFather |
| "Chat not found" | Check channel ID format |
