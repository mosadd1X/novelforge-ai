## Overview

The Enhanced Cover Generator uses advanced programmatic techniques to create visually appealing book covers with intelligent content analysis:

- **Multiple Color Palette Variations** - Each genre has 3-4 different mood-based color schemes
- **Content-Aware Design Selection** - Analyzes book content to select appropriate styles and colors
- **Theme Detection** - Automatically identifies themes like love, magic, mystery, adventure
- **12 Advanced Design Styles** - Including modern, artistic, dramatic, elegant, vintage, and bold
- **Dynamic backgrounds** with gradients, patterns, and sophisticated visual effects
- **Professional typography** for titles, subtitles, and author names
- **Series information display** with consistent branding
- **Proper title case formatting** and visual effects like shadows and embossing

## Enhanced Features

### Content Analysis

The enhanced cover generator analyzes your book's title and description to:

- **Detect themes** automatically (love, magic, mystery, adventure, etc.)
- **Select appropriate color variations** based on content mood
- **Choose optimal design styles** that match the story's tone
- **Apply theme-specific visual elements** for better genre representation

### Advanced Design Styles

- **Modern**: Advanced gradients (angular, radial) with clean geometric elements
- **Artistic**: Sophisticated flowing shapes, waves, spirals with canvas/paper textures
- **Dramatic**: Crystalline shapes with radial gradients and metallic textures
- **Elegant**: Conic gradients with paper textures and refined borders
- **Vintage**: Linear gradients with canvas textures and classic frames
- **Bold**: Crystalline shapes with geometric overlays and transparency effects

### Sophisticated Professional Styles

- **Sophisticated**: Multi-layered design with conic gradients, flowing shapes, and paper textures
- **Cinematic**: Dramatic radial gradients with wave patterns and metallic textures for movie-like appeal
- **Editorial**: Professional angular gradients with canvas textures and clean geometric elements

### Multiple Color Variations

Each genre now includes multiple palette variations:

- **Crystalline**: Angular faceted shapes with geometric precision and random variations
- **Waves**: Sinusoidal wave patterns with variable amplitude and frequency
- **Spiral**: Multi-layered spiral patterns with mathematical precision

### Professional Texture Overlays

- **Paper**: Realistic paper grain with sparse texture variations and authentic feel
- **Canvas**: Woven canvas texture with authentic weave patterns and natural variations
- **Metallic**: Reflective metallic surfaces with directional streaks and brightness enhancement
- **Subtle**: Light noise textures for minimal enhancement without distraction

### Content-Aware Intelligence

- **Theme Detection**: Automatically identifies 10+ themes from book content
- **Mood Analysis**: Analyzes content for dark, bright, dramatic, or magical moods
- **Style Matching**: Selects optimal design styles based on content analysis
- **Palette Selection**: Chooses color variations that match the story's tone

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The cover generator can be accessed through the terminal UI or programmatically:

```python
from src.utils.cover_generator import CoverGenerator

# Create a cover generator instance
cover_gen = CoverGenerator(output_dir="covers")

# Generate a basic cover
cover_path = cover_gen.generate_cover(
    title="The Mysterious Island",
    author="Jane Author",
    genre="Mystery"
)
```

### Advanced Usage

For more customization and enhanced content analysis, you can provide additional parameters:

```python
# Generate an enhanced cover with content analysis
cover_path = cover_gen.generate_cover(
    title="The Mysterious Island",
    author="Jane Author",
    genre="Mystery",
    subtitle="A Journey of Discovery",
    description="A dark mystery set on a remote island where secrets hide in every shadow",
    design_style="dramatic",  # or let it auto-select based on content
    series_info={
        "series_title": "The Explorer Chronicles",
        "book_number": 2
    }
)
```

## Parameters

The `generate_cover` method accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Type | Description                                          | Required |
| ------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| title        | str  | The title of the book                                | Yes      |
| author       | str  | The author's name                                    | Yes      |
| genre        | str  | The book's genre (affects color scheme)              | Yes      |
| output_path  | str  | Custom path to save the cover image                  | No       |
| subtitle     | str  | Subtitle to display under the main title             | No       |
| description  | str  | Book description for content analysis                | No       |
| design_style | str  | Specific design style (auto-selects if not provided) | No       |
| series_info  | dict | Dictionary with series_title and book_number         | No       |

## Color Schemes

The cover generator selects color schemes based on the book's genre:

- **Mystery/Thriller**: Dark blues, purples, and blacks
- **Romance**: Soft pinks, reds, and purples
- **Fantasy**: Deep blues, purples, and greens
- **Science Fiction**: Blues, teals, and blacks
- **Horror**: Reds, blacks, and dark grays
- **Literary Fiction**: Neutral tones with accent colors
- **Historical Fiction**: Sepia tones, golds, and browns
- **Young Adult**: Vibrant, bright colors
- **Children's**: Playful, primary colors

## Typography

The cover generator uses appropriate typography for different elements:

- **Title**: Large, bold font with emphasis effects
- **Subtitle**: Medium-sized font with subtle effects
- **Author Name**: Professional font placement at the bottom
- **Series Information**: Clearly displayed for series books

## Title Case Formatting

The cover generator automatically applies proper title case formatting:

- First and last words are always capitalized
- Major words are capitalized
- Minor words (a, an, the, and, but, for, at, by, etc.) are lowercase when they appear in the middle of the title

## Integration with EPUB Generation

When generating an EPUB file, you can include the generated cover:

```python
from src.formatters.epub_formatter import EpubFormatter

# Format the novel as EPUB with cover
formatter = EpubFormatter(novel_data)
epub_path = formatter.save_epub(output_dir, cover_path=cover_path)
```

## Customization

The cover generator can be customized by modifying the `CoverGenerator` class:

- Change default dimensions in the `__init__` method
- Modify color schemes in the `_get_genre_colors` method
- Adjust font sizes and styles in the `_load_font` method
- Create new background patterns in the `_create_background` method

## Technical Details

The cover generator uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL/Pillow) to create images programmatically. It:

1. Creates a base image with the specified dimensions
2. Generates a background with gradients and patterns based on genre
3. Applies the title with proper formatting and visual effects
4. Adds subtitle if provided
5. Adds series information if provided
6. Places the author name at the bottom
7. Saves the image to the specified output path

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the cover generator:

- Ensure the output directory exists and is writable
- Check that the title, author, and genre are provided
- Verify that any custom fonts are properly installed or accessible
- For custom dimensions, ensure they are appropriate for book covers (typically 6:9 ratio)

## Example Output

The generated covers will be saved as JPEG files in the specified output directory. The default naming convention is:

```
[output_dir]/[sanitized_title]_cover.jpg
```

Where `[sanitized_title]` is the book title with spaces replaced by underscores and special characters removed.
