## Overview

The Novel Generator is responsible for:

1. Initializing the novel generation process
2. Creating a writer profile for the fictional author
3. Generating a novel outline based on genre conventions
4. Developing detailed character profiles
5. Generating chapters with awareness of previous content
6. Coordinating with other components (Memory Manager, EPUB Formatter, etc.)

## Basic Usage

### Initializing a Novel

```python
from src.core.novel_generator import NovelGenerator

# Create a generator instance
generator = NovelGenerator()

# Initialize a novel
memory_manager = generator.initialize_novel(
    title="The Quantum Garden",
    author="Dr. Elise Moreau",
    description="A physicist discovers a way to manipulate quantum particles to accelerate plant growth, creating a garden where time flows differently.",
    genre="Science Fiction",
    target_audience="Adult (18+)",
    output_dir="output/quantum_garden"
)
```

### Generating a Complete Novel

```python
# Generate writer profile
writer_profile = generator.generate_writer_profile()

# Generate novel outline
outline = generator.generate_novel_outline(writer_profile)

# Generate characters
characters = generator.generate_characters()

# Generate chapters
for chapter_num in range(1, outline["chapter_count"] + 1):
    chapter_text = generator.generate_chapter(chapter_num)

# Format as EPUB
epub_path = generator.format_as_epub()
```

## Generation Process

### Writer Profile Generation

The writer profile creates a fictional author persona with:

- Writing background and experience
- Stylistic preferences and influences
- Thematic interests and expertise
- Genre specialization

This profile influences the overall style and approach of the novel.

### Novel Outline Creation

The outline generation process:

1. Determines appropriate chapter count based on genre
2. Creates a high-level plot structure
3. Develops individual chapter summaries
4. Establishes key plot points and their placement
5. Defines the narrative arc and pacing

### Character Development

Character generation creates:

- Protagonist(s) with detailed backgrounds, motivations, and arcs
- Supporting characters with distinct roles and relationships
- Antagonists with clear motivations and obstacles they present
- Character relationships and dynamics

### Chapter Generation

For each chapter, the generator:

1. Retrieves relevant context from the Memory Manager
2. Constructs a detailed prompt incorporating the context
3. Generates the chapter content using the Gemini API
4. Extracts narrative elements from the generated content
5. Updates the Memory Manager with new information

## Customization Options

The Novel Generator supports various customization options:

```python
# Set custom generation options
generator.set_generation_options({
    "chapter_count": 25,           # Number of chapters
    "target_word_count": 80000,    # Target word count for the novel
    "chapter_length": 3500,        # Target words per chapter
    "writing_style": "Descriptive and lyrical",  # Style preference
    "pov": "Third person limited",  # Point of view
    "themes": ["Identity", "Technology ethics", "Human connection"]
})
```

## API Reference

### Key Methods

#### NovelGenerator Class

- `initialize_novel(title, author, description, genre, target_audience, output_dir, series_manager=None, book_number=None)`: Sets up the novel generation process and initializes the memory manager.
- `generate_writer_profile()`: Creates a detailed profile of the fictional author.
- `generate_novel_outline(writer_profile)`: Generates a chapter-by-chapter outline based on genre conventions.
- `generate_characters()`: Creates detailed character profiles with backgrounds and arcs.
- `generate_chapter(chapter_num)`: Generates a single chapter with awareness of previous content.
- `set_generation_options(options)`: Sets custom generation options like chapter length and writing style.
- `format_as_epub(cover_path=None)`: Formats the novel as an EPUB file.

## Genre-Specific Generation

The Novel Generator adapts its approach based on the selected genre:

- **Fantasy**: Emphasizes world-building, magic systems, and character journeys
- **Science Fiction**: Focuses on technological concepts, societal implications, and speculative elements
- **Mystery/Thriller**: Develops clues, red herrings, and builds tension toward resolution
- **Romance**: Centers on relationship development, emotional arcs, and character growth
- **Historical Fiction**: Incorporates period-appropriate details, events, and social contexts
- **Literary Fiction**: Emphasizes character depth, thematic exploration, and stylistic elements

## Integration with Other Components

The Novel Generator works closely with:

- **[Memory Manager](./memory-management.html)**: Maintains context and consistency across chapters
- **[EPUB Formatter](./epub-formatting.html)**: Converts generated content into properly formatted ebooks
- **[Cover Generator](./cover-generator.html)**: Creates covers based on book metadata
- **[Series Manager](./series-generation.html)**: Coordinates series-level consistency when generating books in a series

## Best Practices

For optimal results with the Novel Generator:

1. **Provide Detailed Descriptions**: More specific book descriptions lead to better-focused content
2. **Choose Appropriate Genres**: Select genres that match your content expectations
3. **Review Early Outputs**: Check the writer profile and outline to ensure they match your vision
4. **Use Custom Options**: Adjust generation options to match your preferences for length, style, etc.
5. **Generate Sequentially**: Generate chapters in order to maintain narrative consistency

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Generation Failures**: Check API key status and quota
- **Inconsistent Content**: Ensure the Memory Manager is properly initialized and updated
- **Style Issues**: Adjust the writing style in generation options
- **Length Problems**: Modify chapter length and target word count settings
- **Genre Mismatch**: Provide more specific genre information or adjust the description

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Prompts

You can customize the prompts used for generation by modifying the prompt templates in the NovelGenerator class:

```python
# Example of customizing the chapter generation prompt
generator.chapter_prompt_template = """
[Your custom prompt template here]
"""
```

### Direct API Access

For advanced control, you can access the underlying Gemini client:

```python
# Get the Gemini client
gemini_client = generator.gemini_client

# Make a direct API call
response = gemini_client.generate_content(
    "Your custom prompt",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=4000
)
```
