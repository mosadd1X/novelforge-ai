### Step 7: Zip Your Series (Optional)

Once you have generated multiple books in your series, you can create a zip archive for easy sharing:

1. From the series management menu, select "Zip Series Books"
2. Choose which file formats to include (EPUB only, all ebook formats, or everything)
3. Select where to save the zip file (series directory, Desktop, Downloads, or custom location)
4. Enter a filename for the zip archive
5. The system will create a compressed archive with all your books organized in folders

The zip file will contain:

- Series information file
- Each book in its own numbered folder (Book_01, Book_02, etc.)
- All selected file formats for each book

This makes it easy to share your complete series with others or backup your work.
