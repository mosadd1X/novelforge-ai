## Channel Architecture Strategy

### Single Channel vs. Multiple Channels

**Recommended: Single Unified Channel (For Students)**

**Advantages:**
✅ Easier to manage with limited time
✅ Faster subscriber growth (concentrated audience)
✅ Lower maintenance overhead
✅ Better for GitHub Actions automation
✅ Stronger community building

**When to Consider Multiple Channels:**

- 1000+ subscribers in main channel
- Clear genre preferences emerging
- Generating 10+ books per week
- Different audiences with conflicting preferences

### Genre Organization Within Single Channel

**Use Hashtag Strategy:**

- `#Romance` `#SciFi` `#Mystery` `#Fantasy`
- `#Series` `#Standalone` `#ShortStory`
- `#NewRelease` `#Featured` `#Popular`

**Weekly Genre Rotation:**

```
Week 1: Romance → Sci-Fi → Mystery
Week 2: Fantasy → Thriller → Contemporary
Week 3: Historical → Horror → Adventure
Week 4: Mixed/Popular Requests
```

## Advanced Branding Features
